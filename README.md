# JCR6 for C++

## NOTICE!

This is still a work in progress! It will not be fully functional what you find here (if in fact you find anything functional at all), and although I will not stop you from cloning this repository already. The zlib license this project will have will ONLY count once this notice has been removed! Until that time, you may only clone/download/view this code for evaluation/testing/studying purposes.
